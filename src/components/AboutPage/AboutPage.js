        A gamified classroom allows teachers to easily and quickly reward
        students for participating in the classroom and keep track of all
        students and activity levels throughout one or many classrooms. The
        gamified classroom is aimed to be quick, simple, and easy with limited
        intrusiveness to allow for quick approval by parents and school boards.

        This application was made in a two-week sprint for a middle school
        teacher in VA. I used Javasript, React, Redux, Redux-Sagas, Material-UI
        Node, Express, PostgreSQL, Websockets, Nodemailer, and Passport.
